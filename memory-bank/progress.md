## Evolution of Project Decisions

### üîÑ Key Changes Made

1. **Simplified Session Management** (Week 1)

   - **From**: Complex GUID-based session tracking
   - **To**: Simple file replacement model
   - **Reason**: Reduced complexity for single-user application

2. **Universal Parser Approach** (Week 2)

   - **From**: Format-specific analyzer classes
   - **To**: Single universal parser
   - **Reason**: Better compatibility with diverse Excel models

3. **User-Driven Sheet Selection** (Week 2)

   - **From**: Automatic sheet detection
   - **To**: User selects IS/BS/CF sheets
   - **Reason**: Eliminates auto-detection failures

4. **Formula-Based Hierarchy** (Week 2)
   - **From**: Hardcoded drill-down paths
   - **To**: Excel formula analysis
   - **Reason**: True understanding of model relationships

### üìà Lessons Learned

1. **Architecture Simplicity**: Simpler approaches often work better than complex ones
2. **User Control**: Giving users control reduces system complexity
3. **Universal Compatibility**: Flexibility is more valuable than optimization for specific cases
4. **Progressive Enhancement**: Build core functionality first, add features incrementally

   - Fallback to user selection when uncertain
   - Validation that sheets exist in both models

3. **Create Basic Data Extraction**

   - Extract financial data from detected sheets
   - Handle flexible row/column positioning
   - Build unified data structure for comparison
   - Implement basic error handling

4. **Test with Sample Models**
   - Create test Excel files with different structures
   - Validate parsing accuracy
   - Measure processing performance
   - Identify edge cases and failures

### üîß Success Criteria for Next Session

- [ ] Successfully load and parse Excel files with openpyxl
- [ ] Detect Income Statement, Balance Sheet, Cash Flow sheets
- [ ] Extract financial data into structured format
- [ ] Handle at least 2 different Excel model structures
- [ ] Complete processing in reasonable time (<30 seconds)
