# Financial Model Analyzer - Product Context

## Project Status: MIGRATED TO "MODEL ANALYSIS" PROJECT

**Migration Date**: January 9, 2025  
**Reason**: Core functionality not working, development moved to new project  
**New Project**: Model Analysis

**PROJECT STATUS**: Development discontinued - migrated to "Model Analysis" project

## Why This Project Originally Existed

Financial analysts and finance teams regularly need to compare different versions of Excel financial models to understand what changed between iterations. This comparison process is currently manual, time-consuming, and error-prone, requiring analysts to:

- Manually navigate through multiple Excel sheets
- Identify differences cell by cell
- Calculate variances manually
- Try to understand the business drivers behind changes
- Create summary reports for management

The Financial Model Analyzer automates this entire process, transforming hours of manual work into minutes of intelligent analysis.

## Problems We Solve

### Primary Pain Points

1. **Manual Variance Analysis**

   - Current: Analysts spend hours manually comparing cells between model versions
   - Solution: Automated variance calculation at all hierarchy levels with instant results

2. **Lost Context in Complex Models**

   - Current: Difficult to understand why a high-level number changed when models have hundreds of interconnected formulas
   - Solution: Formula-based drill-down that traces changes to their root causes

3. **Inconsistent Analysis Quality**

   - Current: Analysis quality depends on individual analyst's thoroughness and Excel skills
   - Solution: Standardized, comprehensive analysis with AI-powered insights

4. **Time-Intensive Reporting**

   - Current: Creating executive summaries and variance reports requires additional manual work
   - Solution: Automated report generation with professional formatting

5. **Limited Collaboration**
   - Current: Difficult to share analysis insights and findings with team members
   - Solution: Exportable reports and clear visualization of key findings

### Secondary Challenges

1. **Model Structure Variations**

   - Different analysts structure models differently
   - Our solution works with any Excel model structure without requiring standardization

2. **Period Alignment Issues**

   - Models may have different time horizons or period definitions
   - Our system automatically detects and aligns periods for comparison

3. **Formula Complexity**
   - Complex Excel formulas make it difficult to understand relationships
   - Our parser analyzes formulas to build intelligent drill-down paths
