# Financial Model Analyzer - Project Brief

## Project Status: MIGRATED TO "MODEL ANALYSIS" PROJECT

**Migration Date**: January 9, 2025  
**Reason**: Core functionality not working, development moved to new project  
**New Project**: Model Analysis

## Original Project Overview

The Financial Model Analyzer was intended to be a universal Excel financial model comparison tool that enables users to upload two Excel files (Old vs New models) and automatically analyze variances across all KPIs and hierarchy levels with AI-powered commentary and unlimited drill-down capabilities.

**PROJECT STATUS**: Development discontinued - migrated to "Model Analysis" project

## Core Value Proposition

- **Universal Compatibility**: Works with any two Excel files with similar financial structure, without requiring specific formatting or naming conventions
- **Intelligent Analysis**: Dynamically detects model structure and provides formula-based drill-down capabilities
- **AI-Powered Insights**: Context-aware commentary explaining business drivers of changes
- **Unlimited Drill-Down**: Navigate from high-level variances down to individual cell-level changes
- **Multiple Comparison Modes**: Support for projection vs actual, projection vs projection comparisons

## Key Requirements

### Functional Requirements

1. **Dual File Processing**

   - Upload and validate two Excel financial models
   - Support for different file formats (.xlsx, .xls)
   - Consistency validation between model structures

2. **Dynamic Structure Detection**

   - Automatically identify Income Statement, Balance Sheet, Cash Flow sheets
   - Detect hierarchical relationships within sheets
   - Parse Excel formulas to build drill-down trees
   - Handle cross-sheet references

3. **Variance Analysis**

   - Calculate absolute and percentage variances at all levels
   - Period alignment between different model horizons
   - Statistical significance assessment
   - Component-level attribution analysis

4. **Interactive Navigation**

   - Breadcrumb navigation showing drill-down path
   - Tree view toggle for multi-dimensional navigation
   - Side-by-side variance display (Old | New | $ Var | % Var)
   - Click-to-drill functionality on any line item

5. **AI Commentary**

   - Context-aware business insights using Claude API
   - Level-specific commentary generation
   - Business driver inference and recommendations
   - Model logic analysis and interpretation

6. **Export & Reporting**
   - PDF variance reports
   - Excel data exports
   - CSV raw data downloads
   - JSON hierarchy tree exports

### Technical Requirements

1. **Performance**

   - Complete analysis in <60 seconds for typical model pairs
   - Dashboard rendering in <5 seconds
   - Drill-down navigation in <1 second
   - Support for large Excel files (>50MB)

2. **Reliability**

   - 95% success rate for parsing paired financial models
   - 90% accuracy for hierarchy detection
   - Graceful error handling and recovery
   - Comprehensive input validation

3. **User Experience**
   - Intuitive 4-step workflow: Upload → Select Sheets → Choose Period → Analyze
   - Responsive design for desktop and tablet
   - Clear error messages and guidance
   - Accessibility compliance (WCAG 2.1)

## Success Metrics

### Primary Metrics

- **Universal Compatibility**: Successfully analyze any two Excel files with similar financial structure
- **Analysis Accuracy**: Mathematically correct variance calculations at all hierarchy levels
- **User Adoption**: Intuitive workflow requiring minimal training
- **Performance**: Complete end-to-end analysis within performance targets

### Secondary Metrics

- **AI Commentary Quality**: Meaningful insights for 95% of significant variances
- **Export Utility**: Generated reports meet business reporting standards
- **Error Recovery**: Graceful handling of edge cases and format variations
- **Scalability**: Support for increasingly complex financial models

## Project Constraints

### Technical Constraints

- Must work with existing Excel file formats without requiring model modifications
- Cannot assume specific sheet naming conventions or cell locations
- Must handle formula complexity and circular references gracefully
- API rate limits for AI commentary generation

### Business Constraints

- Single-user application (no multi-tenancy required initially)
- Desktop/tablet focus (mobile optimization not required)
- English language support only
- Private deployment (no public cloud requirements)

### Timeline Constraints

- 16-week development timeline
- Phased delivery with working prototypes at each phase
- User testing and feedback incorporation throughout development

## Risk Assessment

### High-Risk Areas

1. **Excel Format Variations**: Wide variety of financial model structures and formatting
2. **Structure Detection Accuracy**: Automated hierarchy detection may fail on complex models
3. **AI API Reliability**: Dependency on external Claude API for commentary generation
4. **Performance with Large Files**: Memory and processing constraints with complex models

### Mitigation Strategies

1. **Extensive Testing**: Build comprehensive test suite with diverse model formats
2. **Fallback Options**: Manual mapping capabilities when auto-detection fails
3. **Caching & Offline**: Commentary caching and graceful degradation
4. **Progressive Loading**: Chunked processing and streaming for large files

## Technology Stack

### Backend

- **Framework**: FastAPI (Python)
- **Excel Processing**: openpyxl, pandas
- **AI Integration**: Anthropic Claude API
- **Data Models**: Pydantic
- **Server**: Uvicorn

### Frontend
