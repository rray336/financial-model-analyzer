## Overview

The Financial Model Analyzer allows you to upload two Excel financial models (Old vs New) from different periods and automatically:

- **Analyzes variances** across all KPIs and hierarchy levels
- **Detects model structure** dynamically without assuming naming conventions
- **Provides AI-powered commentary** explaining business drivers of changes
- **Enables unlimited drill-down** to investigate variances at any level
- **Supports multiple comparison modes** (projection vs actual, projection vs projection)

---

## System Architecture

### Frontend (React)

- **Dual File Upload Interface**: Clearly labeled "Old Model" and "New Model" upload areas
- **Variance Dashboard**: Side-by-side KPI comparisons with absolute and percentage changes
- **Breadcrumb Navigation**: Drill-down path with toggle to tree view
- **AI Commentary Panel**: Context-aware narratives for each drill-down level
- **Period Analysis Switcher**: Toggle between projection vs actual and projection vs projection views
- **Export Options**: PDF reports, CSV variance data downloads

### Backend (Python FastAPI)

- **Dual File Parser**: Processes Old and New model pairs with format consistency validation
- **Structure Detection Engine**: Dynamically identifies hierarchical organization within sheets
- **Variance Calculator**: Computes differences across all detected hierarchy levels
- **Drill-Down Engine**: Traverses model structure to hard-coded values (leaf nodes)
- **Period Alignment System**: Handles different projection horizons and actual vs forecast comparisons
- **AI Interface**: Enhanced Claude integration with model logic analysis and business inference
- **API Layer**: RESTful endpoints optimized for comparative analysis

## Current Issues

### Universal Compatibility Problems

The system was designed to work with **any** Excel financial model format but currently has significant compatibility issues:

#### Issue #1: Some Excel Formats - Cash Flow Statement Not Working
- **Status**: Income Statement ‚úÖ and Balance Sheet ‚úÖ show line items and variances correctly
- **Problem**: Cash Flow Statement ‚ùå fails to display line items/variances
- **Impact**: 33% of financial statements unusable for certain Excel formats

#### Issue #2: Other Excel Formats - Complete Failure
- **Status**: All financial statements ‚ùå fail to show line items for alternative Excel formats
- **Problem**: No line items display for Income Statement, Balance Sheet, OR Cash Flow
- **Impact**: 100% failure rate for alternative Excel formats

#### Issue #3: UI Bug - Non-Functional New Analysis Button
- **Status**: Top-right "New Analysis" button ‚ùå doesn't do anything
- **Working**: Left-side "New Analysis" button ‚úÖ works correctly
- **Impact**: User confusion with duplicate non-functional buttons

### Root Cause Analysis

**Hypothesis**: Format-Specific Code Assumptions

The variance analysis code contains format-specific assumptions that:
1. Works partially with some Excel formats (Income Statement + Balance Sheet)
2. Fails completely with other Excel formats due to different naming conventions
3. Has specific issues with Cash Flow processing regardless of Excel format

### Key Files to Investigate

**Backend Files:**
- `backend/app/services/universal_parser.py` - Universal Excel parsing and line item extraction
- `backend/app/services/variance_calculator.py` - Variance computation logic
- `backend/app/api/endpoints/analysis.py` - API data serving

**Frontend Files:**
- `frontend/src/components/variance/VarianceTable.tsx` - Line item display
- `frontend/src/components/dashboard/VarianceDashboard.tsx` - New Analysis button

## Session Cleanup

### Overview

Comprehensive guide for safely removing temporary files, test files, and development artifacts at the end of any development session.

### Quick Start

#### Python Script (Recommended)
```bash
# Dry run (safe preview)
python scripts/cleanup_session.py

# Execute cleanup
python scripts/cleanup_session.py --execute

# Custom categories
python scripts/cleanup_session.py --execute --categories test_files cache logs
```

### File Categories

1. **Test Files** (`test_files`) - Project-specific temporary files created for testing
2. **Cache Files** (`cache`) - Generated files that can be safely regenerated
3. **Log Files** (`logs`) - Development and runtime log files
4. **Runtime Temp Files** (`runtime`) - Temporary directories created during runtime
5. **System Temp Files** (`system`) - OS-generated temporary files

### Safety Mechanisms

#### Protected Files (Never Removed)
- Source code files (`*.py`, `*.tsx`, `*.ts`, `*.js`)
- Configuration files (`package.json`, `requirements.txt`, `.gitignore`)
- Documentation (`*.md`, `*.txt`, `README*`, `LICENSE*`)
- Core directories (`src/`, `app/`, `.git/`)

### Cleanup Checklist

#### Pre-Cleanup Checklist
- [ ] All important code changes are committed to git
- [ ] Development servers are stopped
- [ ] No active file uploads or sessions in progress
- [ ] Current work is saved and backed up

#### Post-Cleanup Verification
- [ ] Project still builds and runs correctly
- [ ] Git repository is in clean state
- [ ] No essential files were accidentally removed
- [ ] Development environment functions normally

## Contributing

This project is currently under active development. The implementation follows a structured approach:

1. **Phase-based Development**: Each phase builds on the previous one
2. **Universal Compatibility**: Must work with any Excel financial model format
3. **User-Driven Configuration**: Sheet selection eliminates auto-detection complexity
4. **Formula-Based Intelligence**: Drill-down based on actual Excel formulas

### Development Timeline

- **Week 1-2**: Remove format-specific code, add "New Analysis" button, build sheet selection UI
- **Week 3-4**: Universal period detection, line item matching, basic variance calculation
- **Week 5-6**: Side-by-side variance display, statement selection, period dropdown
- **Week 7-8**: Formula parsing, dependency mapping, drill-down functionality
- **Week 9-10**: Polish, error handling, testing with diverse Excel models

### Success Criteria

- **Universal Compatibility**: Successfully analyze any two Excel files with similar financial structure
- **User Experience**: Intuitive 4-step workflow (Upload ‚Üí Select Sheets ‚Üí Choose Period ‚Üí Analyze)
- **Formula Intelligence**: Accurate drill-down through Excel formula dependencies
- **Performance**: Complete analysis in <60 seconds regardless of Excel model source
- **Maintainability**: Extensible patterns for new period formats and formula types
